# tasty-th

Automatically generate tasty TestTrees from functions of the current module, using TemplateHaskell.
This is a fork the original [test-framework-th](https://github.com/finnsson/test-generator) package, modified to work with tasty instead of test-framework. Usage is exactly the same as for the original package.

### Usage

To use this package, you need to enable TH and import the package plus the required tasty modules:

```
{-# LANGUAGE TemplateHaskell #-}
module Main where

import Test.Tasty
import Test.Tasty.TH
import Test.Tasty.QuickCheck
import Test.Tasty.HUnit
```

Then, write a few unit tests and QuickCheck properties:

```
prop_length_append :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Bool
prop_length_append as bs = length (as ++ bs) == length as + length bs

case_length_1 :: Assertion
case_length_1 = 1 @=? length [()]
```

`tasty-th` assumes that all QuickCheck properties are named `prop_something` and HUnit tests are named `case_something`. You can also group tests under a test tree and have them be discovered by `tasty-th` so they are added to the main test tree. In that case, you can define a `test_something` definition:

```
test_plus :: [TestTree]
test_plus = 
  [ testCase "3 + 4" (7 @=? (3 + 4))
    -- ...
  ]
```

After you've defined all your tests in this way, you can now automatically generate a main function using the `defaultMainGenerator` TH macro provided by `tasty-th`:

```
main :: IO ()
main = $(defaultMainGenerator)
```

It is important that you place this at the end of the file, since GHC only sees the definitions prior to the TH call.

If you don't wish to generate a main function, but instead just want a TestTree, you can use the `testGroupGenerator` macro for that:

```
tests :: TestTree
tests = $(testGroupGenerator)
```

Running the example, we get the following output:

```
./example
Main
  length append: OK (0.01s)
    +++ OK, passed 100 tests.
  length 1:      OK
  plus
    3 + 4:       OK

All 3 tests passed (0.01s)
```

You can find this whole example in the file `example.hs` at the root of the source code tree.
